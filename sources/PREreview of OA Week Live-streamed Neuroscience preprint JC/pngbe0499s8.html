Ideally you would like to make the sequence public and also comment on how many siRNAs they tried.&nbsp;</li><li>Minor thing but when there are less than 50 observations it'd be really awesome to see the individual points for each of the bar charts like there are in the paired line plots (Figs 1-7).</li><li>Also for e.g. difference in initiations: it'd be cool to just show the absolute number of initiations in each case (rather than subtracting the number in the vehicle condition). The data are very convincing so it'd be great to see all of it!</li><li>fig 1: just use a color panel to illustrate the groups as females and males, no need to caption repeatively. Same suggestions for Fig3.</li><li>Fig. 8: the "inhibitory" arrow is unclear: in particular, does it mean that 5-HT_2 activation inhibits NPF signaling, or does it mean that a *reduction* in 5-HT_2 activation inhibits NPF signaling?</li><li>First use of NPFr should say "receptor".</li></ul><div></div><div><b>Poll results:</b></div><div></div>
