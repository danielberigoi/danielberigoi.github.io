There is a lot of data that can be conflicting across different model differences. What is serotoning doing? How do you reconcile what happens in invertebrates with other finding in vertebrates. Can we really start to parse out some of these elements on how we can have multilple different effects with the same neurntransmitter.&nbsp;I would be really interested to know what are the different roles of aggresion evolutionarily in these model and non-model organisms. Might this underly some of the differences?</li><li>By looking at different receptor subtypes, maybe they were getting at differences between specific populations of neurons, and rather than serotonin having a global influence on aggression it acts in neurons to modulate different aspects of aggression depending on which population of neurons its acting in. Maybe this is something the authors could comment on, or build upon for future experiments.</li><li>What is the affinity of 5HT to the different subtypes of receptors? If this is know, perhaps the authors can include this in the discussion.</li><li>how incresed aggression elavates 5-HT2 in stalked-eye fly</li><li>Could you make a fake opponent that a fly might engage or retreat from, even if there is a large difference in size? You might be able to pull apart different responses by doing this. You&nbsp;could put them up against a mirror maybe, and see if they fight themselves.</li><li>I am wondering whether aggression behaviors would happen, when 5-HT receptors are manipulated, across sexes?&nbsp; Or would the fly just try to mate with the other sex more (as its aggressive behavior)</li><li>Is there a preferrence of aggression test for sex difference?&nbsp;</li><li>Is there a difference in males vs females of 5-HT_2 (or others) following 5-HT_2 siRNA? [see Figs 4 and 5]</li><li>Coming from a recent background of clinical research writing, I am conditioned to look for numbers of patients through the trial. Would you be able to show how many flies you tested at each stage, how many were lost from the data due to behavioural abnormality, injection failure, death etc? I worked with rats 15 years ago and these data were never included in publications but I would like to think that being transparent about such aspects leads to greater reproducibility and therefore credibility.</li><li>Is it possible to elucidate a causal role for Tk and/or NPF by injecting/expressing them directly?</li><li></li></ul><h2 data-label="476186" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><h2 data-label="476186" class="ltx_title_subsection">Minor comments:</h2><ul><li>At line 253 in the manuscript (Materials and Methods) section I found that that section should be in the results section and not in the methods. </li><li>It would be better to include more details about the siRNA procedure. Ideally you would like to make the sequence public and also comment on how many siRNAs they tried.&nbsp;</li><li>Minor thing but when there are less than 50 observations it'd be really awesome to see the individual points for each of the bar charts like there are in the paired line plots (Figs 1-7).</li><li>Also for e.g. difference in initiations: it'd be cool to just show the absolute number of initiations in each case (rather than subtracting the number in the vehicle condition). The data are very convincing so it'd be great to see all of it!</li><li>fig 1: just use a color panel to illustrate the groups as females and males, no need to caption repeatively. Same suggestions for Fig3.</li><li>Fig. 8: the "inhibitory" arrow is unclear: in particular, does it mean that 5-HT_2 activation inhibits NPF signaling, or does it mean that a *reduction* in 5-HT_2 activation inhibits NPF signaling?</li><li>First use of NPFr should say "receptor".</li></ul><div></div><div><b>Poll results:</b></div><div></div>
