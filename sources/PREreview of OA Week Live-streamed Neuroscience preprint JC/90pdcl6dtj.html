<ul><li>Tricky to follow at the beginning</li></ul><div></div><div><b>Questions for the authors:</b></div><ul><li>Where are we before and where are we after this preprint. There is a lot of data that can be conflicting across different model differences. What is serotoning doing? How do you reconcile what happens in invertebrates with other finding in vertebrates. Can we really start to parse out some of these elements on how we can have multilple different effects with the same neurntransmitter.&nbsp;I would be really interested to know what are the different roles of aggresion evolutionarily in these model and non-model organisms. Might this underly some of the differences?</li><li></li></ul><div></div><div></div><div><b>Poll results:</b></div><div></div>
