<ul><li></li><li>How many people know how cool the fly is. A simple photo would have been useful, but high-sepeed video recording would have been really useful addition to the paper.&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;it would be very nice to see a video that shows how the behavior changes after the manipulations</li><li>Would be useful to bring what is known from the field and bring that to the table for this organism</li><li>Tricky to follow at the beginning</li><li>I think some of the things that were in the discussion would have been super useful to have in the introduction. Like their aims and justifications for using this species.&nbsp;</li><li>Every piece of data was treated with the same importance. Would be useful to break their data apart a little : emphasize the important results more, and place other less important results in an Appendix/Suppl. Fig./Table. It's tough to parse out the importance at present- so this would help increase clarity of the paper.&nbsp;</li><li>I do like the table in the last figure to bring it all together, though maybe a model diagram/visual would be helpful, and this could be compared to other invertebrates and vertebrates</li><li>within the result having each result contrasted with a species that is already know, to give context.</li><li>it was tough to visualize the behavioral types (initiation, high-intensity, etc.) A picture of each would have been a great deal of help for the reader to know what exactly is happening, maybe defining the behaviour types a bit more.&nbsp; The context given about the behavior did not really help me see what was going on.</li><li>they seemed to be pulling data from different organisms and I did not see the best connection between the organisms, seemed a bit unorganized in the referential data they were bringing from one section to the next.</li><li>I think they may need to add other behavior test to test aggression such as maternality for females.&nbsp;</li><li>Some of the figures show changes in certain levels of neuropeptides in females either after isolation or certain treatments, but are not significant. It would have been interesting if the authors talked more about possible minor effects these changes are causing and if they might be affecting other behaviors, even if the changes were not drastic enough to be significant changes.</li><li>Maybe it was just a change in the amount of movement that was causing some of these changes in aggression. Having the video footage might help us understand this more. Maybe we are missing some of these lower level behaviours</li><li>If&nbsp;the 5HT receptors are  similar between drosophila and the stalk-eyed fly, could reagents (particularly immunohistochemistry) be used in the stalk-eyed fly to look at receptor subtype localization/co-localization, and protein levels?&nbsp;- this might help with comparison to the Dros literature</li><li>For the forced fight paradigm, specifically the siRNA and 5-HTP experiments, they didn't specify if the opponents were socially reared, and if they were familiar with their opponent. In some species, aggression differs toward familiar and nonfamiliar conspecifics, so this could potentially change the outcome of the fight</li><li>Distinction between aggressive bout initiation vs the intensity of the individual experience was a very interesting element that it would have pulled out more.&nbsp;The high speed videoing may help with this. Maybe machine learning/AI could help distinguish between this.</li></ul><div></div><div><b>Questions for the authors:</b></div><ul><li>Where are we before and where are we after this preprint. There is a lot of data that can be conflicting across different model differences. What is serotoning doing? How do you reconcile what happens in invertebrates with other finding in vertebrates. Can we really start to parse out some of these elements on how we can have multilple different effects with the same neurntransmitter.&nbsp;I would be really interested to know what are the different roles of aggresion evolutionarily in these model and non-model organisms. Might this underly some of the differences?</li><li>By looking at different receptor subtypes, maybe they were getting at differences between specific populations of neurons, and rather than serotonin having a global influence on aggression it acts in neurons to modulate different aspects of aggression depending on which population of neurons its acting in. Maybe this is something the authors could comment on, or build upon for future experiments.</li><li>What is the affinity of 5HT to the different subtypes of receptors? If this is know, perhaps the authors can include this in the discussion.</li><li>how incresed aggression elavates 5-HT2 in stalked-eye fly</li><li>Could you make a fake opponent that a fly might engage or retreat from, even if there is a large difference in size? You might be able to pull apart different responses by doing this. You&nbsp;could put them up against a mirror maybe, and see if they fight themselves.</li><li>I am wondering whether aggression behaviors would happen, when 5-HT receptors are manipulated, across sexes?&nbsp; Or would the fly just try to mate with the other sex more (as its aggressive behavior)</li><li>Is there a preferrence of aggression test for sex difference?&nbsp;</li><li>Is there a difference in males vs females of 5-HT_2 (or others) following 5-HT_2 siRNA? [see Figs 4 and 5]</li><li>Coming from a recent background of clinical research writing, I am conditioned to look for numbers of patients through the trial. Would you be able to show how many flies you tested at each stage, how many were lost from the data due to behavioural abnormality, injection failure, death etc? I worked with rats 15 years ago and these data were never included in publications but I would like to think that being transparent about such aspects leads to greater reproducibility and therefore credibility.</li><li>Is it possible to elucidate a causal role for Tk and/or NPF by injecting/expressing them directly?</li><li></li></ul><h2 data-label="476186" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><h2 data-label="476186" class="ltx_title_subsection">Minor comments:</h2><ul><li>At line 253 in the manuscript (Materials and Methods) section I found that that section should be in the results section and not in the methods. </li><li>It would be better to include more details about the siRNA procedure. Ideally you would like to make the sequence public and also comment on how many siRNAs they tried.&nbsp;</li><li>Minor thing but when there are less than 50 observations it'd be really awesome to see the individual points for each of the bar charts like there are in the paired line plots (Figs 1-7).</li><li>Also for e.g. difference in initiations: it'd be cool to just show the absolute number of initiations in each case (rather than subtracting the number in the vehicle condition). The data are very convincing so it'd be great to see all of it!</li><li>fig 1: just use a color panel to illustrate the groups as females and males, no need to caption repeatively. Same suggestions for Fig3.</li><li>Fig. 8: the "inhibitory" arrow is unclear: in particular, does it mean that 5-HT_2 activation inhibits NPF signaling, or does it mean that a *reduction* in 5-HT_2 activation inhibits NPF signaling?</li><li>First use of NPFr should say "receptor".</li><li>this research was very insect-centric but there was not much about the ralationship back to mammals, relationship with human health.</li><li>For instructions, i suggest to shrink them down by grouping the informaton for the reasons to use stalked-eye fly. I would put the informations of NPY and sex difference to aggression to discussion.&nbsp;</li><li>For the title, i would suggest to reform it to show the key questiions they are answering&nbsp;</li><li>For discusiion, more information about the 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptor in other organisms during agression should be added.</li><li>I was also looking for more links to other animals and humans, and on lines 132-135 there is a link with mice; however I think the statement is the wrong way around because reference 12 covers flies not mice.</li><li></li></ul><div></div><div><b>Poll results: - needs restructuring (if we decide to include these results)</b></div><div></div>
