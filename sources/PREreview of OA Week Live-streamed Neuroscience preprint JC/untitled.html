<div></div><h1 data-label="392870" class="ltx_title_section"><b>Overview and take-home messages:</b></h1><div>The study looked at the differential changes in behaviour following manipulations of both gene expression and the local environment of the stalk-eyed fly, in particular socialization, following a 7-day period of isolation. The genes of interest are all related to Serotonin signalling - a neurotransmitter linked to aggression in both invertebrates and vertebrates (perhaps in opposite ways). The authors found that 5-HT2 receptors played an inhibitory role in regulating the&nbsp;<i>initiation</i> of aggressive behaviours using siRNA knockdown experiments. In contrast, higher&nbsp;<i>escalation</i> of aggressive behaviours was observed following  application of 5-HT, which the authors speculate was linked to increase Tk expression. Notably both decreased 5-HT2 receptor expression and increased Tk expression were observed in socially isolated males, who were also more aggressive in both measures suggesting that these two parallel pathways might confer a survival advantage under these environmental conditions. The authors did not observe these effects in female stalk-eyed flies, but it is unclear whether this results from different aggression pathways, or is a reflection of the specific behavioural assays used to assess aggression in this study.</div><div></div><h1 data-label="260841" class="ltx_title_section"><b>Positive remarks:</b></h1><div>The journal club participants were surprised that such a ubiquitous neurotransmitter can have such disparate effects across organisms and sexes, and led to the question of how  we are able to create such different behaviours using a single molecule. Participants were particularly intrigued by the finding that&nbsp;different sub-types of 5-HT receptors  exert opposing effects according to the context. This led to  questions about differences in sub-type affinity and any potential impact on sex differences of expression. Furthermore, it was an interesting finding that there were sex-specific effects on aggression after isolation; in particular that  size differences  affect the aggressive behaviour of the male fly vs. a lack of aggressive behaviour regardless of size or rearing for females. We know so little about the associated receptors: where and how much they are expressed. There is still so much to investigate. This is one great aspect of this paper.&nbsp;</div><div></div><h1 data-label="731764" class="ltx_title_section"><b>Constructive feedback:</b></h1><h2 data-label="233033" class="ltx_title_subsection"><b>Visualisation / Presentation</b></h2><ul><li>How many people know how cool the stalk-eyed fly is? A simple photo and high-speed video recordings would be a really useful addition to the paper. Furthermore, it would be very nice to see a video that shows how the behaviour changes after the manipulations.</li><li>It was difficult to visualize the behavioural types (initiation, high-intensity, etc.). Therefore, a picture of each type would have been helpful for the reader, together with additional  behavioural descriptions. As above, a video/picture would say a thousand words.</li></ul><div></div><h2 data-label="317172" class="ltx_title_subsection"><b>Background / Structure</b></h2><ul><li>The introduction was difficult to follow at the beginning. It would be useful to reveal what is known from the field and discuss how that&nbsp;related to this organism.</li><li>It would be really useful to add to the introduction some of the ideas that were in the discussion, for example, the aims and justifications for using this species.&nbsp;</li><li>Every piece of data was treated with the same importance. It would be useful to break the data apart a little to emphasize the important results, and place other less important results in an Appendix/Supplemental Figure/Table. It is difficult&nbsp; to parse out the importance at present, so this would help increase the clarity of the paper.&nbsp;</li><li>Although Table 2 was useful to help summarize the findings of this manuscript,  a model diagram/visual would be helpful, particularly to bring these findings into context with what is known in other invertebrates and vertebrates. This could be placed at the end of the manuscript, but referred to in the introduction also (re: what is already known in the literature).</li><li>In line with the above, it would be helpful if each result can be contrasted with a species that is already known in order to give context. Furthermore, when different organisms were mentioned, the connection and comparison between them was not always clear.&nbsp; The referential data changed species from one section to the next, causing some confusion. Therefore, it may be helpful to focus on one or two species for clarity.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2 data-label="980637" class="ltx_title_subsection"><b>Technical Questions / Controls</b></h2><ul><li>It seems possible that the test for aggression is only ethnologically relevant for males. Is there a preferred test  of aggression  for sex difference, or are there  other conditions, for example maternality-related aggression tests, that would be able to pull out differences in the effects of manipulations for females? It would be useful to be able to generalize across aggressive behaviours, otherwise it is important to state in the discussion that the results apply to this prototype of behaviour specifically.&nbsp;In other words,  the authors did not observe these aggressive effects in female stalk-eyed flies, but it is unclear whether this results from different aggression pathways, or is a reflection of the specific behavioural assays used to assess aggression in this study. This should be commented on in the discussion.&nbsp;</li><li>For the forced fight paradigm, specifically the siRNA and 5-HTP experiments, were the opponents socially reared? Furthermore, were the opponents&nbsp; familiar with each other? In some species, aggression differs toward familiar and non-familiar conspecifics, so this could potentially change the outcome of the fight.</li><li>Have the authors considered, and/or tested, whether a change in the amount of movement may have  caused some of these differences in aggression? Having the video footage might help us understand this more. It is possible that some  lower level behaviours are being missed that would be captured by video analyses.</li><li>Distinction between aggressive bout initiation vs the intensity of the individual experience was a very interesting element and the manuscript would have benefited from emphasizing this more. This is a curious finding, and we would have liked to know more. The high speed videoing may also help with this and could allow the incorporation of machine learning/AI to help distinguish between these two types of behavioural responses. An example of this type of software would be 'deeplabcut' (Mathis et al. Nat Neurosci, 2018).</li><li>If&nbsp;the 5-HT receptors are&nbsp; similar between&nbsp;<i>Drosophila</i> and the stalk-eyed fly, could reagents (particularly immunohistochemistry) be used in the stalk-eyed fly to look at receptor sub-type localization/co-localization, and protein levels? If so, this might help the authors compare their results with the <i>Drosophila</i> literature.</li><li>More specific antagonists/agonists for these receptors are needed as the pharmacology is limited.</li></ul><div></div><h2 data-label="996460" class="ltx_title_subsection"><b>Questions for the authors:</b></h2><ul><li>The manuscript could have benefited from more details on where  we stand before and where  we are after this preprint. There is a lot of data that can be seen as conflicting across different model system and it would be useful to discuss this more. Furthermore, fundamental questions like "What is serotonin doing?" and "How do you reconcile what happens in invertebrates with other findings in vertebrates?" would be valuable additions to this manuscript. Can we really start to parse out some of these elements on how we can have multiple different effects with the same neurotransmitter? It would be really interested to know what  the different evolutionary roles of aggression are in these model and non-model organisms. Might this underlie some of the differences?</li><li>By looking at different receptor sub-types, were the authors trying to address behavioural differences between specific populations of neurons, or were they trying to suggest that serotonin is having a global influence on aggression? If so, this would suggest that serotonin acts in specific neurons to modulate different aspects of aggression depending on which population of neurons it is acting in. Maybe this is something the authors could comment on, or build upon for future experiments.</li><li>Some of the figures show changes in the levels of neuropeptides for the females either after isolation or after treatments, but these changes are not significant. It would  be interesting if the authors could expand upon possible minor effects these changes may cause and if they might be affecting other behaviours, even if the changes are not drastic enough to be significant.</li><li>What is the affinity of 5-HT to the different sub-types of receptors? If this fact is known, perhaps the authors can include it in the discussion.</li><li>How does increased aggression elevate 5-HT2 in the stalked-eyed fly?</li><li>Could you make a fake opponent that a fly might engage or retreat from, even if there is a large difference in size? The authors might be able to pull apart different responses by doing this. Alternatively, the authors could place the flies up against a mirror, and see if they fight themselves.</li><li>We wondered whether aggression behaviours would happen across sexes when 5-HT receptors are manipulated, or whether the fly would show increased mating behaviours with the other sex  due to their increased aggressive behaviours. The authors may wish to comment on this in the discussion.</li><li>Is there a difference in 5-HT2 (or other) expression between males and females following 5-HT2 siRNA? [see Fig. 4 and 5].</li><li>The manuscript would benefit from showing  how many flies were tested at each stage, how many were lost from the data due to behavioural abnormality, injection failure, death etc? This would increase transparency about such aspects and lead to greater reproducibility and therefore credibility (note: this is a general point for scientific practices rather than a specific point about this manuscript).</li><li>Is it possible to elucidate a causal role for Tk and/or NPF by injecting/expressing them directly?</li></ul><h2 data-label="476186" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><h1 data-label="323425" class="ltx_title_section">Minor comments:</h1><ul><li><b>Title:</b> the authors may consider modifying the title to emphasize the key questions that are being addressed by this work. We feel this would increase the clarity and impact of this work.</li><li><b>Introduction:</b> it might be useful to reduce its length by grouping the information for the reasons to use the stalk-eyed fly. In lines 107-126, the authors demonstrate that the stalk-eyed fly can be a useful modeI to detect the conflict (i.e, initiation, escalation and termination). In lines 151-171, the authors demonstrate that the stalk-eyed fly can be an ideal model for examining inset aggression in a sex-dependent manner. It might be beneficial to place the information about NPY and sex difference in aggression    (lines 127-171) in the discussion instead.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Introduction:</b> More links to other animals and humans would be useful. In lines 132-135: there is a link with mice; though the statement may be the wrong way around because reference 2 covers flies not mice, and reference 22, mice but not flies.</li><li><b>Line 242:</b> First use of NPFr should say "NPF receptor". If abbreviated, NPFr  should be consistent throughout the text (see Lines 333, 334 later in the text).</li><li><b>Materials and Methods, Line 253:</b> this paragraph appeared to be more relevant for the results section than for the methods section.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Line 262:</b> the reference to Fig. 1 is apparently incorrect.</li><li><b>Line 277:</b> it would be beneficial to include more details about the siRNA procedure.
