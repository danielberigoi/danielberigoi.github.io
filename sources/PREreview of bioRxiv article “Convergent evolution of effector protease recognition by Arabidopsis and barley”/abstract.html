<div>This is a review of Carter, Helm et al. bioRxiv 374264; doi:&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/374264">https://doi.org/10.1101/374264</a> posted on July 23, 2018. In this paper, the authors showed that diverse barley cultivars are able to respond to the Pseudomonas syringae effector AvrPphB and they characterized&nbsp; both the effector target (PBS1) and the receptor (PBR1) responsible for this recognition. Furthermore, their phylogenetic analyses revealed that the immune receptor involved in this response is not orthologous to a previously characterized receptor (RPS5) from Arabidopsis thaliana that has a functionally analogous AvrPphB recognition mechanism. This leads the authors to conclude that recognition of the AvrPphB protease has evolved independently in Arabidopsis and barley.</div>
