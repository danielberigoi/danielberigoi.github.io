These different treatment 'levels' are misleading if described as disturbance levels since this description can be interpreted as disturbance intensity if not read carefully. Clarity of language surrounding disturbance manipulation is really important for specific understanding and placing the study in the wider context of studies of disturbance. We suggest changing 'levels' to frequency/ies' throughout - 'levels' does not appeal to a wider audience, and is currently only serving to reduce the manuscript's potential reach and impact.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>2. We suggest including T0 samples in the NMDS plot  in Figure 1B. However, we were not able&nbsp;to understand why two different ordination methods were used in Figure 1 and suggest using only one method (NMDS or PCoA). The plot could be combined into one, if color represents disturbance frequency and shape represents time.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>3. The frequency of measurements implies sampling with replacement (but this was not mentioned in the methods section), we would like to see a description of  how replacement was achieved and discussion of what the impacts of replacement may have been. We are also interested in the implications of scaling up the microcosm size and varying initial conditions  to reproduce and expand the experimental&nbsp;design for further work testing the new model.</div><div></div><div>4. Since the Results section appears before the Materials and Methods section in this manuscript, we suggest writing out the full names of abbreviated terms in the Results section so that readers can read sections in the order they appear and know what the abbreviations represent.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>figure symbols and colors</div><div></div><div><b>1) In Results section, line 115. We were a bit confused about the use of word "dispersion" as it has different meaning in island ecology. Dispersion in island ecology means (observed mean nearest neighbour distance)/(expected mean nearest neighbor distance), whereas in Figure 1 dispersion is used to represent PCoA analysis of relative bacterial abundance.</b></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>4) Although, at several points in the paper, the authors reference the softwares used, and sometimes, the corresponding parameters, we would encourage the authors to share both the raw data (the performance indicators in addition to the raw sequences, which are available on NCBI) and the accompanying code used to analyze it (github or similar site). In some cases the citations are missing for the relevant packages or software. Sharing the code would shed light on the details of some procedures that are not made explicit in the manuscript, and increase the reproducibility of the experiment.</div><div></div><div>This comment is unique to the preprint. The layout of the preprint, which we understand is likely the result of the requirements of a submission format, makes understanding the figures more difficult that necessary. For future preprint submissions, we encourage the authors to consider associating the figures with their titles and captions, and  to put the figures inline, close to the relevant parts of the text.</div><div></div>
