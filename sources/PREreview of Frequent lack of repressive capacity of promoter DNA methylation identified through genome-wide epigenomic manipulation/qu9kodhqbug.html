<div>Overall, this is a very interesting work, clearly presented and illustrated with attractive and informative visualizations. Although more work is needed to understand how 5mC stability is achieved, the authors correctly conclude that in their model DNA methylation itself is frequently insufficient to transcriptionally repress promoters. This information may prove highly useful for designing methylome-editing strategies.</div><div></div><div>Thanks again for posting this interesting work as a preprint,</div>
