<div></div><div>This  study used an impressive number of individuals from over a nine year  period to address an interesting question that can have implications not  only in ecology  but also in human health and how it will interact with  climate change. However, some of the participants found the narrative a  bit confusing and thought a clearer description of the objectives in  the introduction would be helpful. Additional clarification was also  requested in the methods. In particular, the molecular methods were not  clear particularly on how new lineages were determined with the PCR  approach and how the authors dealt with co-infections.&nbsp;</div><div></div><h1>Major point:</h1><ul><li>One  of the main questions that was raised during the discussion was how the  5 new parasite lineages were defined. The manuscript would benefit from  more justification for the molecular approaches used to identify and  define these lineages. For the PCR and sequencing for example, it was  not clear why a single nucleotide difference equates to a new lineage.  PCR amplification can cause single nucleotide changes and also this  lineage identification is based on a single gene. Even if cytochrome b  is conserved enough to allow this inference, single nucleotide changes  could be a PCR artifact. Further discussion around these points would be  significantly improve the manuscript.</li></ul><h1>Minor points:</h1><ul><li>Table  3 was identified as confusing by a number of participants who also  suggested that perhaps a more detailed caption could alleviate this.  Also,  the authors should expand on what it means to be rescaled, and  what the biological meaning is.</li><li>&nbsp;It would be helpful to include the phylogenetic trees (even in the supplemental) or combined with figure 1 </li><li>For  figure 1, in addition to the above suggestion, it would be useful to  include (n=) next to host species along x axis, and&nbsp; add "Parasite" to  the "lineage" legend</li><li>It would be interesting to see an  additional figure that shows a plot across time: how prevalence changed  over the 9 years of the study&nbsp; (even average prevalence)</li><li>ggplot palates are not colour blind friendly and suggest using shapes or a colour blind friendly palate like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.1618">https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.1618</a></li><li>It  would be helpful to mention how the authors accounted for potential  co-infections. This is something that can be pretty common to be  infected by more than one lineage, which may complicate the analyses.  The authors should comment on this in the discussion, if not elsewhere</li></ul><h1>Typos: </h1><ul><li><div>Line 137: "were" --&gt; was?</div></li></ul>
