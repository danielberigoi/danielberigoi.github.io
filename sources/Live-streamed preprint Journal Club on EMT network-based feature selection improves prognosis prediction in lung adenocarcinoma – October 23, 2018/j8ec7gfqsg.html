<ul><li>It would be useful to add a paragraph to the Discussion highlighting (1) how this approach could be utilized to better target a set of prognostic markers from patient samples and (2) the potential generalization of this approach to other cancers.&nbsp;</li><li>To avoid ambiguity, it would be better to use "AUROC" or "ROCAUC" instead of just "AUC". Moreover, this abbreviation and     "AUPR " should be defined at their first usage (line 185).  “ROC-PR” should be “AUPR.”</li><li>TCGA LUAD data should be cited according&nbsp;    to <a href="http://gdac.broadinstitute.org/runs/info/DOIs__stddata.html">guidelines given by the Broad Institute</a>.</li><li>For a network visualization, the <a href="http://www.htmlwidgets.org/showcase_networkD3.html" target="_blank">networkD3 package in R</a>&nbsp;is very useful.</li><li>    To improve readability of the preprint, it would be helpful to (1) print the supplementary table numbers and/or captions directly above their corresponding table contents, and (2) print the figure numbers on the same page as each figure (pages 20-30).    </li><li>    Depending on the style guide, Ref. 37 should state that it is a PhD dissertation.
