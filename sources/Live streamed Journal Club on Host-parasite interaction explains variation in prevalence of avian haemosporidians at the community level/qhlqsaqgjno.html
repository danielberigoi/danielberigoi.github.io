<div>Summary:&nbsp;</div><div>In this paper the authors tackle the question of which host variables (phylogenetic, seasonal, or host-pathogen-specific) affect parasite prevalence&nbsp; and specialization in various species of bird.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div></div><h1 data-label="488681" class="ltx_title_section">Overview:</h1><div>This study used an impressive number of individuals from over a nine year period to address an interesting question that can have implications not only in ecology  but also in human health and how it will interact with climate change. However, some of the participants found the narrative a bit confusing and thought a clearer description of the objectives in the introduction would be helpful. Additional clarification was also requested in the methods. The molecular methods were not clear particularly on how new lineages were determined with the PCR approach and how the authors dealt with co-infections. </div><div></div><div>Minor points:</div><ul><li>Table 3 was identified as confusing by a number of participants who also suggested that perhaps a more detailed caption could alleviate this</li><li>&nbsp;It would be helpful to include the phylogenetic trees (even in the supplemental) or combined with figure 1 </li><li>ggplot palates are not colour blind friendly and suggest using shapes or a colour blind friendly palate like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.1618">https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.1618</a></li></ul><div>Typos: </div><ul><li><div>Line 137: "were" --&gt; was?</div></li></ul><div></div>
