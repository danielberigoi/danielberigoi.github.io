<ul><li>I'm a theater making rapper who uses research to put together presentations. I'm not the only one. I&nbsp; don't have the capacity for review, and my counterparts just want to make&nbsp; a&nbsp; hot show, so a lot of mess ends up in the presentations. Also the lack of diversity doesn't&nbsp; help&nbsp; much either in terms of perspective in the narratives I make.</li></ul>
