<ul><li>Having been in a lab where we have used thousands of datasets from other labs to build a tool that can be used to analyse genomics data, I understand how frustrating it might be to not know what the reuse policies are for these datasets, and how much time it might waste having to request permissions. This manuscript helps to address where the situation lies right now, with the hope that this might help develop more clarity in future policies.</li></ul>
