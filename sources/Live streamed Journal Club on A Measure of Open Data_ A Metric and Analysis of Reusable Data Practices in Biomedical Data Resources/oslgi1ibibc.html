<ul><li>I'm interested in monitoring policies across fields or different organizations. The development of a rubric enables comparisons, a birds-eye view, and advocacy for change. Furthermore, our current MozSprint project, TRANSPOSE, is a journal database built on a similar YAML architecture :) ASAPbio is also working on preprint licensing, and while the options typically available to people in that space are more restricted (to CC licenses), preprint servers offer different levels of clarity and machine access to these licenses. This framework could be extended or modified to categorize information about that space.</li></ul>
