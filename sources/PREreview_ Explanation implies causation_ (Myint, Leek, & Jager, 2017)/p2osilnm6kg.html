<div>We really enjoy Table 1, and the CC BY helps for reuse in classes. What we did during the reading of the paper was draw out the percentage correct in a simple plot, to visualize how the conditions relate to each other. This also facilitates the interpretation in light of the hypotheses, which seem to imply a main effect and an interaction. We think it would be helpful  if you would add such a visualization, because in our experience the interpretation is easier to discern visually.&nbsp;</div>
