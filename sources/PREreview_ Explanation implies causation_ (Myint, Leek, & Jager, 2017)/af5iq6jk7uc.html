<div>Published empirical research papers oversell results and exaggerate claims by using inappropriate and out of scope statements. Rises in "inappropriate causal language" are mentioned for a few fields, such as nutritional and educational fields. Considering that humans seek order in the world, it seems plausible that this also happens in the interpretation of research findings, but that researchers might forget to keep these claims tentative. If such language affects the interpreted scope of the results, it is important as a self-reflection in order to adjust writing behavior in the future to better reflect the scope of the analysis.&nbsp;</div>
