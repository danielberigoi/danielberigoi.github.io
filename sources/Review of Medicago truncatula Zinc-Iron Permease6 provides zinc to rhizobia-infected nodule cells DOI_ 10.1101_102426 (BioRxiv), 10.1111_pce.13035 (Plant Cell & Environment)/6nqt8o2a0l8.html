It was stated that higher accumulation occurred in the differentiation zone of the mutant nodule. However, the images gave a differing impression. It is clear that the zinc does not disperse into the rest of the nodule and remains in the differentiation zone, but a higher zinc accumulation compared to WT nodule is not clear. Perhaps it should be noted in the figure legend that fig. 6d had been altered in order to avoid oversaturation in the image. &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Positive feedback:</b></div><div></div><div>Figure 1A and figure 2 were the key figures where authors had the chance to support their initial claims on gene expression of&nbsp;<i>MtZIP6</i>&nbsp;in nodules and its localization to differentiation zone. Localization experiments displayed in figure 3 were necessary to support their claims on the localization of MtZIP6 to the plasma membrane. We appreciated the three-dimensional reconstruction to&nbsp;point out the localization more clearly.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Furthermore, we really liked the transient expression assay in Agrobacterium infiltrated tobacco leaves to show plasma membrane localization of MtZIP6. The result was clean and succinct, MtZIP6 overlayed perfectly with plasma membrane localized&nbsp;CFP. We wish it was included in&nbsp;Figure 3 along with other localization experiments.</div><div></div><div>Figure 4 and 5 provided much-needed insight into the function of MtZIP6. But we think that these two figures can be combined together and this will help to provide a better view of the overall picture about the vital need of MtZIP6. This would also have provided space to include the tobacco results in the paper instead of supplemental material.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Abreu&nbsp;<i>et al.</i> showed nicely in figure 6, the possible role of&nbsp;<i>MtZip6</i> as zinc transporter in rhizobia-infected nodules. We think it is very interesting&nbsp;that knockdown of&nbsp;<i>MtZip6</i> does not affect zinc concentration in the plant. This result suggests a nodule-specific function of the&nbsp;<i>MtZip6</i> transporter. </div><div></div><div>The novelty of MtZIP6 is a notable finding and gives exciting justification to characterize the protein. Overall the paper and its findings were easily understood, even of nonexperts.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div>
