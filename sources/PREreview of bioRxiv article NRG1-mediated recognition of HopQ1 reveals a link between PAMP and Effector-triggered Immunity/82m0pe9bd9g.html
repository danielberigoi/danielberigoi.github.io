<div><b>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><b>NRG1 expression is induced at the early stages of the bacterial infection</b>: (1) with biolistic delivery system of HopQ1 in Nb, the authors found no reduction of GFP signal (whereas a reduction in At was observed); when leaves were pre-treated with Agro, a significant reduction of GFP signal was measured; (2) when Nb leaves were infiltrated with Flg22 peptide, NRG1 expression was induced compared to NRG2 (N-terminally truncated) control</div>
