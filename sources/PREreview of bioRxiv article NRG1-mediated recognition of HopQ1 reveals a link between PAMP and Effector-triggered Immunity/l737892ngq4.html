<div><b>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><b>Expression of NRG1 in&nbsp;<i>A. thaliana</i>(At) confers recognition to HopQ1 and restricts&nbsp;<i>Pto</i>growth:&nbsp;</b>HopQ1 and GFP reporters were transiently expressed in 35s:NbNRG1 transgenic At lines using biolistic delivery, and HR was evaluated by quantifying a reduction of the GFP signal resulting from cell death; found a greater reduction in GFP signal in 3/5 NRG1 lines, compared to GUS lines; in these 3 lines,&nbsp;<i>Pto</i>proliferation was also reduced in infection assays</div>
