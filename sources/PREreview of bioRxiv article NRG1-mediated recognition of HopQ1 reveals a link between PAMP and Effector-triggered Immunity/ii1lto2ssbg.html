<div>o&nbsp;&nbsp;Although mentioned in both the introduction and discussion, the authors donâ€™t explore whether HopQ1 and XopQ, a homolog from&nbsp;<i>Xanthomonas</i>, are recognized by a shared resistance mechanism. Either XopQ should be downplayed in these sections, or the resistance mechanism trigged by this effector should be experimentally explored.</div>
