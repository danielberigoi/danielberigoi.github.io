<div>o&nbsp;&nbsp;It cannot be concluded from these experiments that PTI activation is required for the function of NRG1. Agro infiltration could have multiple effects on the plant, thus more controls are required. For example, is there the same effect with flg22 treatment +/- FLS2?</div><div></div><div>o&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression analysis lacks proper controls, e.g. unrelated genes not involved in PTI or functional R genes that do not require PTI priming to induce HR. Moreover, the expression levels of NRG1 upon flg22 treatment do not necessarily reflect the relative abundance of this protein within the cell. &nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\)</span></div>
