<div>o&nbsp;&nbsp;The robustness of the method used to assay the cell death response is unclear. There is inherent variability in the system as demonstrated by the differences in GFP levels in the EV control, so can it be claimed that HopQ1 has less GFP expression due to the activation of HR? A reduction in GFP over time may serve as a better internal control than a comparative approach.&nbsp;</div>
