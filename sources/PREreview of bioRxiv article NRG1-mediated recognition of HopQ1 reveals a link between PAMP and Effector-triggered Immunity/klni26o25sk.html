<div>The authors show that (1) the RNL NRG1 is required for HopQ1-mediated cell death in&nbsp;<i>N. benthamiana&nbsp;</i>and that NRG1 silencing in&nbsp;<i>N. benthamiana </i>compromises the resistance to DC3000. They also show evidence that (2) expression of NRG1 within the normally susceptible plant&nbsp;<i>Arabidopsis thaliana&nbsp;</i>is sufficient to confer HopQ1-triggered cell death, as well as confer resistance to DC3000. In addition, the authors present evidence that (3) NRG1 is induced at an early time-point following PTI activation and hypothesize that this represents a link between PTI and ETI.&nbsp;</div>
