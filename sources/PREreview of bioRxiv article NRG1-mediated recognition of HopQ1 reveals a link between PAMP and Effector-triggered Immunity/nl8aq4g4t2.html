<div>o&nbsp;&nbsp;The conclusion that NRG1 expression in At induces recognition of HopQ1 to restrict DC3000 growth is not justified from the experiments shown because (1) NRG1 has been implicated in the function of multiple R genes and (2) overexpression can cause HR. Better controls are required to make this claim, such as assaying a DC3000 strain lacking the HopQ1 effector to determine if NRG1 affects other R protein / effector interactions within At.</div>
