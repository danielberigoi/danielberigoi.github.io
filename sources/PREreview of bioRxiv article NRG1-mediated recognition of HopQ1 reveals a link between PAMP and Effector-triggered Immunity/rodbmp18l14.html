<div>This paper builds on the authors’ previously published method to identify candidate R genes in&nbsp;<i>N. benthamiana</i>for a given target effector. In this paper, they employ this method to determine the R gene(s) required to confer recognition to the&nbsp;<i>Pto</i>effector HopQ1, which “is the sole effector [from&nbsp;<i>Pto</i>]… recognized in both&nbsp;<i>Nb&nbsp;</i>and<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>” (lines 96- 97). They argue that the widespread conservation of HopQ1 among phytopathogenic bacteria means that, “the identification of R proteins able to recognize [this] effector is potentially valuable to achieve resistance to a wide range of plant pathogens” (lines 106- 107).&nbsp;</div>
