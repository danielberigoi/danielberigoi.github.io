<div>o&nbsp;&nbsp;At no point is the resistance gene Roq1 mentioned in these sections, even though it is known that HopQ1 is directly recognized by Roq1 in&nbsp;<i>N. benthamiana&nbsp;</i>(Schultink et al 2017). As written, it is not clear how the authors propose that NRG1 functions in mediating the cell death response triggered by Roq1 recognition of HopQ1, or how NRG1 functions in restricting&nbsp;<i>Pto</i>proliferation.&nbsp;</div>
