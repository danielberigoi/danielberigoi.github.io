<div></div><div><i>Write here any additional comment you might have (this includes minor concerns such as typos and structure of the manuscript)</i></div><div>In the introduction clarify the distinction between previous findings in human and animal models. It would be important to mention if there is any evidence that supports the fact that older humans have harder time understanding fast speech. You might want to mention that the way that the startle response circuit is wired  in humans is different from  the rat.&nbsp;</div><div>In the introduction I wonder if you need to go into such details to understand the circuit in order to motivate the study. I would focus on stating the problem, what's known about the problem, what's you hypothesis, and how you are going to test it. Conclude the intro with a short paragraph about your findings. Leave the description of the methods to the method session. </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>Figure 9 tries to compare behavior and ephys. Never found figure 9. Move up. Erick and Luke have a problem about this figure. You have a linear scale on one axis and a ratio on the axis. You can't compare much? But PPI is already a rotio. Why not doing a ratio of the ratio. It should be something where you can compare the change on one axis to the change in the other axis. y axis 0 means no change 1 means no change in EFR. The message si that the behavior of the animal changes more compared to the electorphy responses.One panel with change in 100% PPI and another with change in EFR and then you compare between the groups rather than comparing between the measures? We don't know what the baseline is. Did you try doing everything in a multiple linear regression. Does EFR predict PPI on individual level not for averages. PPI=a+b*EFR. </div><div>If 4 is true then 5 follows? Figure 7 is the most interesting. Onse you equated the level you are still getting much less PPI in the older. Equated things periferally but the PPI is much lower. THere is somethnig going on passed the periferal. EFR is a mixed measurment. </div><div>The relative change affects the behavior rather than the absolute repsonse? the 50% depth and 100% is similar in younger but performance is quite different. The relative change in EFR does not predict the behavior? That's figure 9. You need a bettere figure for that one. </div><div></div>
