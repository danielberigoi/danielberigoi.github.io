The acoustics startle stimulus also goes to AC. </div><div>The way that the startle response works in humans is different mention it. </div><div>Include a diagram of the behavioral paradigm in the paper.</div><div>Figure 1 put this in there instead of the square to show the waveform. </div><div>Good psycometric function on the top but not on the bottom. Better measurement of threshold from the magnitude. Important to figure out how to find animal metheds that relate to human methods. Nice Psychometric function. Plot the psychometric funrtion fecause it's well behave but it's confusing. Did you actually get the threshold? The ABR is always an overestimate. Too high threshold. In the behavior she did not get into the threshold. THreshold level in whcih there is on change in the startle response. You should highly the important part. What is the important part? What is the table doing?Relative to 75 what is the first level that is significantly lower.</div><div>All you need to say is that the anova is the main effect and not an effect of age.</div><div>Figure 2. lable that it's the prepulse AM frequency in the figure. SVD do you need to report the RMS for every figure or is reduntant? You can use your 8kHz detection to show that the task track with stimulus level. Use only magnitude. It's saying the same thing. You can mention the stat of the RMS is only in the methods.</div><div>Confusing Figure 3 wave 1 match, within animal to measure detaction threshold. What are the matched wave? Confused that the response is sometimes even higher. Important is to make the point. More variability in the older group. It would have been nice to match the aged to the young but it's tecnically young. Measure the ABR, find a level that you find in all the older and then have ...Future direction is that this is what you should do. Cool that you got good responses for such low level? 85 and matched waveform. Focus on the one that you think is better and play that up. Would it be useful to visualize the mean of the matched intensity. Was there a lot of variability? mixed of hair cell loss and synaptopathy. </div><div>Figure 4. TMTFs What channel is this for for the lower is Ch1 and ch2 for higher. Solid should be 100% and 25% for young get rid of it altogether. Surprising that there is such a difference between ephys and behavior???? Not sure. comparing the prepulse inhibition (no effect of stimulus level) and EFR is not a great comparison (large effect of stimulus intensity) suggests different mechanism. How do you measure the EFR? amplitude over the whole time--&gt;FFT over the whole time. The matching is hard...</div><div></div><div>Figure 9 tries to compare behavior and ephys. Never found figure 9. Move up. Erick and Luke have a problem about this figure. You have a linear scale on one axis and a ratio on the axis. You can't compare much? But PPI is already a rotio. Why not doing a ratio of the ratio. It should be something where you can compare the change on one axis to the change in the other axis. y axis 0 means no change 1 means no change in EFR. The message si that the behavior of the animal changes more compared to the electorphy responses.One panel with change in 100% PPI and another with change in EFR and then you compare between the groups rather than comparing between the measures? We don't know what the baseline is. Did you try doing everything in a multiple linear regression. Does EFR predict PPI on individual level not for averages. PPI=a+b*EFR. </div><div>If 4 is true then 5 follows? Figure 7 is the most interesting. Onse you equated the level you are still getting much less PPI in the older. Equated things periferally but the PPI is much lower. THere is somethnig going on passed the periferal. EFR is a mixed measurment. </div><div>The relative change affects the behavior rather than the absolute repsonse? the 50% depth and 100% is similar in younger but performance is quite different. The relative change in EFR does not predict the behavior? That's figure 9. You need a bettere figure for that one. </div><div></div>
