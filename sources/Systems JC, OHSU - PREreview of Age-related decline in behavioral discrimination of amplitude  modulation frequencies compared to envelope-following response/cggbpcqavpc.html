<div>The relative change affects the behavior rather than the absolute repsonse? the 50% depth and 100% are similar in younger but performance looks quite different. It appears that the relative change in EFR does not predict the behavior. Is that correct? </div><div><i>Write here any additional comment you might have (this includes minor concerns such as typos and structure of the manuscript)</i></div><div>Introduction: </div><ul><li>I wonder if you need to go into such details to understand the circuit in order to motivate the study. I would focus on stating the problem, what's known about the problem, what is/are you hypothesis/es, and how you are going to test it/them. Conclude the intro with a short paragraph about your findings. Leave the description of the methods to the method session. P</li><li>Perhaps it would be helpful to clarify the distinction between previous findings in human and animal models. It could be important to report any psychophysical evidence that supports how older humans have harder time understanding fast speech. Additionally, you might want to mention that the way that the startle response circuit is wired  in humans is different from  the rat.&nbsp;</li></ul><div></div><div></div>
