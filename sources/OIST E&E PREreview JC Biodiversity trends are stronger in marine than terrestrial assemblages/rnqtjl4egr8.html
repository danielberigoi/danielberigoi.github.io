<div>As the aim of the Preprint Journal Club is to support the authors by providing constructive feedback, the reviewer(s) should also include positive remarks to encourage future posting of preprints. Remember, the authors are human too! To help guide you, here are a few questions you might ask yourself after reading the preprint:</div><div></div><div><i>What result did you find the most interesting and why?</i></div><div><i>What did you learn from their research that really fascinated you?</i></div><div><i>Did you think of any future exciting directions this research could take, or future experiments the researchers could try? Try to include experiments that are not critical to this particular preprint but the research area in general.</i></div><div><i>Did you learn anythi</i><i>ng from this preprint that you would include in your future work? Examples could be a new technique, a new way of approaching an idea, a certain way of interpreting the type of data, a good way of summarising the results, the structure of the manuscript if it is clear and logical, etc.</i></div><div><i>What ideas for further research are based on the preprint? [Note: this encourages preprint authors for their early sharing and promotes openness among reviewers as well.]</i></div><ul><li>The code is very well commented and easy to access in Zenodo.&nbsp;</li></ul><div></div>
