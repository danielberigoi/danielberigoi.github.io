In addition to most of the data used in this paper being available in a public data base, the code for the analyses is extremely well commented and available on Zenodo. Meta-analysis like this, while difficult, are absolutely necessary to illuminate larger ecological trends, and we thoroughly appreciate the effort made here.&nbsp;We sincerely hope that our comments are useful to the authors and we look forward to reading the final version when it is published.&nbsp;</div>
