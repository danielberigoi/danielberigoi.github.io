<div><i>“[First author] et al. have made significant advances in [x, y and z] by showing that … In addition, they have bridged the gap in our knowledge about how [process i interacts with process ii].

The paper has focused on testing a viral replicon system with two different enzymes, nuclease and nickase, as well as an&nbsp;<i>in planta</i> gene targeting (IPGT) system in&nbsp;<i> Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. Interestingly, authors have chosen GLABROUS1 (GL1), a regulator of trichome formation, as a visual marker to detect Cas9 activity and therefore homologous recombination. A 10 bp deletion in the coding region of&nbsp;<i>GL1</i> gene produces plants devoid of trichomes. Out of the two methods&nbsp;<i>in planta</i> gene targeting approach successfully restored trichome formation in less than 0.2% of ~2,500 plants screened, whereas the method based on viral replicon machinery did not manage to restore trichome formation at all. This manuscript is of high quality, experiments are well designed and executed. However, there are some concerns that could be addressed in the next preprint or print version. Below are some feedback and suggestions that we hope will improve the manuscript.</div><div></div>
