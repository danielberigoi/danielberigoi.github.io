Using a different 10 base-pair long nucleotide sequence, yet encoding same amino acids, within the constructs&nbsp;was a clever idea to prevent a possible pollen contamination from wild-type plants. Subsequently, Figure 2 shows the working principle of the constructs shown in Figure 1. The design of Figure 2. did a good job of helping the reader to visualize and differentiate between methods of enhancing HT availability.&nbsp;</div>
