<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The authors indicate in Figure 4 that some plants appeared to have fully restored trichome formation in the T3 generation. Sequencing results in panel B show that the non-glaborous plants are heterozygous as opposed to their chimeric parents. In the Results paragraph for Figure 4, it would be beneficial to indicate that the plants are heterozygous for more clarity. In addition, for panel 4B, it would help the reader if the color of the nucleotide letters on the X-axis matched the color of the peaks.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure 3A, left is referenced in the text (lines 285-288)to be a T3 plant, however, the figure legend states that all plants shown in the figure are T2 plants. The authors state that plants transformed with pVIR-Nick are shown in Figure 3A (line 274), nevertheless, plants transformed with pIPGT-Nuc and pVIR-Nuc are shown. In the text and in Figure 3B it is stated that there are 42 clones but when the different clones displayed in Figure 3B are added together the total number adds up to 41.</div><div></div><div></div>
