<div></div><div></div><div>In this study the authors tackle the extremely interesting topic of transgenerational immune priming in invertebrates. The authors designed an experiment to test whether the parasite strain infecting the parental generation improves the offsprings resistance to that strain more effectively than their resistance to other strains. This experiment essentially tests the specificity of immune priming at a very fine scale. The results did not support parental infection strain differentially affecting offspring resistance to different strains, indicating that immune priming is not specific to the strain level in this system.   These results are very interesting, however there are a few concerns that could be addressed in the next version of the manuscript, which are outlined below.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Super cool - P5 facilitating infection, impressive model fit&nbsp;</div><div>geneotyping samples would be super interesting&nbsp; - accidental directed evolution ?&nbsp;</div><div></div>
